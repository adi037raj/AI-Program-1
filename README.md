# searching-Algorithm-in-AI
In this project , we have implemented varoius search algorithm, In this we have stated a interactive problem, where the lion wants to eat the meat(Goal) , using DFS ,BFS , Varying cost function and A* Algorithm

# In second part
I have done a small comparison program using open gym AI
# In 3rd part
A genetic Algorithm  in chess queen problem
# In 4th part
